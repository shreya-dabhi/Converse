This is a chat application that I made while learning Firebase. I
have implemented features such as a user can interact with their 
friend by searching their username and can do chat with them. 
The user has to sign up/sign in in order to use the app. She/he 
can set a username and profile picture. I have learned a lot of 
things about Firebase like Firestore, Storage, and Authentication.
Also, I have Implemented new Material Design 3 concepts.
